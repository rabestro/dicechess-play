	// Why a one-time dialog is acceptable on an anonymous-first site: the person just clicked "Sign in".
	// This is the completion of an action they took, not an interruption of one. It never appears for a
	// guest, and it appears at most once per account per browser.
	//
	// Why the claim offer belongs HERE rather than only on /me: the guest identity is per-browser, so
	// the moment right after signing in is the one time we know for certain which anonymous history is
	// in front of us. Someone who signs in, plays as their account, and only later finds /me may have
	// no idea their earlier games can still be adopted.
	//
	// The claim step is skipped when there is demonstrably nothing to adopt — an offer to link zero games
	// is noise, and it would teach people to dismiss this dialog without reading it. "Demonstrably" is
	// load-bearing: an unread count means offer, never skip (see hasSomethingToClaim).
