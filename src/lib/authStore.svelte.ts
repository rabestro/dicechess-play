// Identity for the public play site: an anonymous guest by default, a real account once signed in.
//
// Anonymous-first is a product decision, not a limitation (ADR-0017): guest play must never degrade
// or nag, so `status` starts as `loading` and settles on `signed-out` for most visitors — which is a
// normal state here, not a failure. Signing in only ADDS a rating and bot management.
//
// Two things this store deliberately does NOT have:
//
//   - **No email and no Google avatar.** play-api's `/auth/me` answers id/nickname/rating only;
//     email lives in `user_identities` and never reaches a public wire. The nav therefore shows the
//     nickname and a locally derived initial — there is no picture URL to show, and inventing one
//     would mean asking Google for profile scope the backend does not use.
//   - **No token.** The session is an HttpOnly cookie on play-api's host; the SPA cannot read it, so
//     "am I signed in?" is only ever answered by asking the server (`refresh()`).
//
// The `user`/`balance`/`isApproved`/`isAdmin` surface below is kept because the ported lab
// play-with-bot store consumes it. `balance` remains a local-only number for the (guest-disabled)
// betting UI — it is not an account balance and no server knows about it.
