/**
 * Loads and holds the guest's finished lobby/live games from play-api (#151) — the
 * server-authoritative counterpart to `localGamesStore`'s IndexedDB-backed bot games.
 *
 * A singleton so the loaded list survives navigation, matching `localGamesStore`; call
 * {@link load} to (re)fetch the first page — pass `vs`/`result` to narrow the server-side query
 * (#151/#173), forwarded to `fetchPlayerGames` verbatim and remembered for {@link loadMore}. A
 * no-op (empty `games`, no error) when live play is off (`VITE_PLAY_API_URL` unset) — same rule
 * that disables `/live`. Any fetch failure degrades to an honest `error` flag rather than
 * throwing: the local list on `/games` must always render regardless of play-api's health.
 *
 * `/games`'s filter bar reloads this store every time `vs`/`result` change (a fresh server query,
 * not client-side post-filtering — see `gamesFilters.ts`'s doc comment for why). Call {@link reset}
 * first: it bumps a generation counter so a request from before the filter change (or a stale
 * `loadMore` from before a `reset`) can't land after the new one and clobber it, however the two
 * happen to resolve — same pattern as `playerOpponentsStore`.
 *
 * Pagination (#150): {@link loadMore} appends the next page (same filters, `before` = the oldest
 * fetched game's own `finishedAt`) rather than replacing `games`. `hasMore` is the server's own
 * count, not something inferred client-side — see `gameHistoryPagination.ts` for how the page
 * combines it with local games to decide what's actually safe to render.
