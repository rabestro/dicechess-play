# dicechess-play

The public **Dice Chess play site** ([play.jc.id.lv](https://play.jc.id.lv)) — anonymous, no
sign-up. Two ways to play:

- **`/play` — against our bots**, fully in the browser: the Scala.js engine runs client-side in
  a Web Worker, so a game needs no server at all. Finished games are recorded to
  `dicechess-analytics` as the `playsite` source.
- **`/lobby` + `/live/[id]` — against another human**, served by the sibling `dicechess-play-api`.
  That server is authoritative: it owns the dice (provably fair), the clocks, and move legality;
  this client only applies versioned events and rolls back optimistic moves.

Around them: a bot catalog (`/bots`), the rating ladder (`/leaderboard`), local + server game
history with replays (`/games`, `/replay/[id]`), and a guest profile (`/me`).

## Stack

SvelteKit 2 · Svelte 5 (runes) · Tailwind 4 · `adapter-static` (SPA, `ssr=false`) · PWA
(`@vite-pwa/sveltekit`). Game rules come from one place — the `@rabestro/dicechess-engine`
(Scala.js) artifact, pinned in `package.json`. Theme system (7 themes) is shared with
`dicechess-analytics-ui`.

## Getting started

```bash
export NODE_AUTH_TOKEN=ghp_xxx   # PAT with read:packages — see Configuration
mise run setup                   # npm install
mise run hook:install            # register the lefthook Git hooks (once per clone)
mise run dev                     # vite dev → http://localhost:5173
mise run check                   # eslint + prettier --check + svelte-check
mise run test                    # vitest run
mise run compile                 # vite build → dist/
```

Only the `@rabestro` scope resolves from GitHub Packages (see `.npmrc`), and that needs
`NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` even though the packages are public — everything else, chessground included,
comes from the public npm registry. Failure signature: `npm install` dies with `401 Unauthorized`
on `@rabestro/dicechess-engine`.

Run `npm ci` right after every `git pull`: a stale `node_modules` makes local Prettier disagree
with CI and produce phantom formatting drift.

To work on live play, run `dicechess-play-api` locally and point `VITE_PLAY_API_URL` at it in
`.env.local`.

## Configuration

| Variable                  | When           | Effect                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`         | install        | GitHub PAT with `read:packages`, for the `@rabestro` scope                      |
| `VITE_INGEST_GATEWAY_URL` | build (client) | Base URL of the ingest gateway. Empty = recording off (games stay in IndexedDB) |
| `VITE_PLAY_API_URL`       | build (client) | Base URL of play-api. Empty = the `/live` routes are disabled                   |

`VITE_*` values are **baked into the bundle at build time** — the site is Direct-Uploaded to
Cloudflare Pages, so Pages dashboard variables never reach `vite build`. Changing either one means
a rebuild and redeploy; in CI they come from repo variables.

## How recording works

Finished games are saved to IndexedDB (`localGamesDB`, `sync_status: 'pending'`), then
`flushOutbox()` maps each to `GameIngestWire` and `POST`s it to the **ingest gateway**
(`VITE_INGEST_GATEWAY_URL`, a separate service — `dicechess-ingest-gateway`). The gateway holds
the analytics Bearer token, re-validates via an engine replay, and forwards to
`dicechess-analytics`. The browser never holds `INGEST_TOKEN`.

Identity: `source='playsite'`; human = `guest:<uuidv7>` (per-browser), bot =
`bot:<algorithm>` (shared with the extension, disambiguated by `source`); game id =
`UUIDv5('playsite/game/<uuid>')`.

A 400/422 from analytics is permanent: `gatewayClient` classifies it as `rejected`, the outbox
quarantines the record and never retries it. Games only reachable through the live surface are
recorded by play-api itself, not from here.

## Deploy

Every push to `main` builds in GitHub Actions and Direct-Uploads `dist/` to Cloudflare Pages
(`.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`) — so **never commit to `main`**. Building in Actions is what
keeps the packages PAT out of Cloudflare. Releases are a manual `Ops: Release` dispatch that bumps
a git tag; `package.json` stays at `0.0.0`.

## Open follow-ups

- [ ] **Outbox retry backoff** — a `rejected`/`error` record is left pending and retried on the
      next flush with no delay (the `quarantined` state for 422 rejects is already implemented).
