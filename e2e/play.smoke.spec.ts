// — rolldown miscompiled the Scala.js engine, `DiceChess.applyMove` returned undefined for every
// move, and both stores read that as "illegal move" and snapped the piece back. Every unit test
// passed, because none of them touch the bundle.
//
// So this runs a real turn against the built dist: pick a piece, play a legal move, assert the
// game's history counter advanced. It is deliberately blind to which colour, opponent or dice the
// game hands out — it hunts for a movable piece instead of assuming one.

 * `square.move-dest` once a movable piece is selected, so finding a movable piece means clicking
 * pieces until dests appear — but the bot moves on its own clock, and its re-render drops the
 * selection and leaves the dest squares behind as hidden nodes. Selecting in one step and moving in
 * a later one therefore races the bot: the dest resolves, then never becomes clickable.
 *
 * The turn may also belong to the bot, or the roll may have handed this seat nothing playable (the
 * store then auto-passes) — so a sweep that finds nothing is normal and just retries.
