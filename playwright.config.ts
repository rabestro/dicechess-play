// exactly as it deploys. That is the whole point: vitest imports the Scala.js engine straight from
// node_modules and never bundles it, so a bundler that miscompiles the engine passes every other
// gate (see #185, and `scripts/verify-bundle.mjs` for the narrower engine-only guard).
//
// `npm run build` must have run first — the web server here only serves dist/, it does not build.

// Set SMOKE_BASE_URL to run the same suite against an already-deployed site instead — a PR preview
// or production — which is how you confirm a deploy is playable without clicking through it:
